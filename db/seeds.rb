# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

#db/seeds.rb
require "json"

politicians.each do |attrs|
  # If you want to re-run seeds without duplicates, find by slug first
  record = Politician.find_or_initialize_by(slug: attrs["slug"])

  # assign_attributes lets us update existing records, too

    full_name:   attrs["full_name"],
